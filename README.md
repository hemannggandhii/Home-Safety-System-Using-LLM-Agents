# Home-Safety-System-Using-LLM-Agents

## Project Overview
In this project, we will create an innovative home safety system that leverages the power of Large Language Model (LLM) agents to improve household security. This system will be versatile, capable of performing tasks like detecting intruders, monitoring for fire or smoke, and even identifying stray animals on the property. Our goal is to harness LLMs for real-time decision-making to enhance smart home safety features.

## Motivation
As homes become smarter, ensuring safety and security remains one of the top priorities for homeowners. Traditional systems focus on predefined triggers like alarms or cameras, but with LLM agents, we can build a system that doesn’t just detect events but reasons about them and takes appropriate actions autonomously. By incorporating LLMs, this project aims to push the boundaries of what home security systems can do, making them smarter and more adaptable.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Reasoning**: The LLM agents will analyze inputs in real-time to make decisions about potential safety risks.
- **Comprehensive Safety Functions**: The system will include multiple functionalities such as fire detection, intruder alerts, and stray animal notifications.
- **Easy Setup and Customization**: The system will be simple to configure, allowing homeowners to tailor it to their specific needs with minimal effort.

## Deliverables
- Develop basic LLM agents that can reason about different safety scenarios and generate relevant code snippets.
- Equip the agents with specific tools for tasks like fire detection or intruder alerts.
- Provide clear documentation on system setup, functionality, and usage.
- Produce a final demonstration video and deliver fully functional code.

## Technologies We Will Use
- **Python**: To code and implement the project.
- **Langchain Framework**: For building and deploying LLM agents.
- **Google Colab**: To enable fast, GPU-powered computations without needing specialized hardware.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x**: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- **Google Colab Access**: Since we’ll need GPU support for faster model training and processing, we’ll use Colab.
- **Required Libraries**: Install the necessary dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file using the following command:

```bash
pip install langchain
