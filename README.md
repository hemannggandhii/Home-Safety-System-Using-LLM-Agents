# Home Safety System Using LLM Agents

## Motivation
As homes get smarter, security and safety need to evolve too. Instead of relying on traditional systems that require manual configuration or preset rules, weâ€™re aiming to build a system that thinks on its own. By using Large Language Models (LLMs), this project will create a home safety solution that detects dangers like intruders, fires, or even stray animals, and responds intelligently. Our goal is to make home safety smarter, more adaptable, and capable of real-time decision-making.

## Design Goals
- **Intelligent Decision-Making**: Build a system that can autonomously respond to different home safety threats (like fires or intruders) using LLM agents.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Ensure that the system can detect threats and notify users instantly.
- **Easy to Use and Adapt**: Make the system simple to set up and flexible enough to fit different home environments and needs.
- **Scalable**: Allow for easy scaling if additional sensors or features are needed in the future.

## Deliverables
- **LLM Agent Implementation**: Create and train LLM agents to reason and respond to different safety threats (e.g., fire detection or intruder alerts).
- **Fully Functional Home Safety System**: A complete system that detects and alerts the user in real-time about home safety issues.
- **User Documentation**: Clear and detailed documentation on how to set up, use, and troubleshoot the system.
- **Final Demonstration**: A video demonstration showing the system in action, highlighting the features and functionality.

## System Blocks
1. **LLM Reasoning Engine**: The heart of the system, responsible for analyzing real-time inputs (e.g., camera, sensors) and making decisions.
2. **Sensor Integration**: Modules that process data from cameras or sensors (like motion detectors, smoke alarms) and feed this data to the LLM.
3. **Notification System**: Alerts the user via phone or other devices when a threat is detected (e.g., SMS, push notifications).
4. **User Interface**: A simple dashboard for users to monitor the system and configure alerts and settings.
5. **Data Processing**: Handles the incoming data from various sensors and prepares it for analysis by the LLM.

## Hardware/Software Requirements
### Hardware:
- A computer (or access to Google Colab) with GPU support for faster processing.
- Optional: Cameras or motion/temperature sensors to simulate real-world inputs.

### Software:
- **Python 3.x**: Core programming language for the project.
- **Langchain Framework**: For building and integrating LLM agents.
- **Google Colab**: For GPU processing and model training (if local GPU isn't available).
- Additional libraries: `langchain`, `opencv-python`, `numpy` (to handle image and video processing).

## Team Members Responsibilities
- **Your Name**:
  - **Lead Role**: Software implementation, algorithm design, and technical research.
  - **Tasks**: Implement the LLM agents, integrate them with sensor data, and ensure that the system runs smoothly.
  
- **Manay Gala**:
  - **Lead Role**: Setup, networking, and documentation.
  - **Tasks**: Handle the system setup, assist with networking aspects (if necessary), and write user and technical documentation.
